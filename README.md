Big data has revolutionized the way we gather and analyze information. 
And it also has become a valuable resource for businesses and researchers alike. 
However, this abundance of data also presents a challenge in terms of extracting meaningful insights.

One of approaches to dealing with big data is to use machine learning algorithms to find patterns and relationships in the data. 
However, these algorithms require large amounts of computational resources and can be slow and inefficient when dealing with massive datasets. 
To overcome this challenge, researchers often choose a subset of the data to work with.

Choosing a good sub-dataset is crucial for accurate model estimation and prediction. 
A good sub-dataset should be representative of the entire dataset, while also being large enough to capture the important patterns and relationships.
for example, Fang et al. (2000).This requires careful consideration of the data's distribution and characteristics.

Once a suitable sub-dataset has been selected, machine learning algorithms can be used to build models that can be applied to the entire dataset. 
These models can then be used to make predictions, identify trends, and gain insights into the underlying processes driving the data.

The linear models are common model for analyzing relationships between variables in large datasets. 
However, with the increasing size and complexity of big data, traditional linear models may not always be feasible due to computational limitations. 
As the size and complexity of big data continue to grow, it is important for researchers and analysts to stay up to date with the latest computational techniques and modeling approaches to ensure that they are able to effectively analyze and extract insights from these massive datasets.
